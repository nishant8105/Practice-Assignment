# Python Practice Assignments

This repository serves as a collection of Python practice assignments and exercises, documenting the learning journey through various programming concepts.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into assignment folders, each containing Python scripts and related documentation.

### Assignment 1: Introduction to Python
- **task1.py**: Performs basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) on two user-inputted numbers.
- **task2.py**: Demonstrates string handling and user interaction by greeting the user with their first and last name.
- **tasks.md**: Detailed task descriptions for Assignment 1.

### Assignment 2: Control Flow and Logic
- **Task1.py**: Logic to determine if a number is even or odd using bitwise operators (`&`) and conditional statements.
- **Task2.py**: Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 49 using a `for` loop.
- **Task_Report.md**: A report or documentation related to the tasks in Assignment 2.

### Assignment 3: Functions and Modules
- **Task1.py**: Calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function.
- **Task2.py**: Performs mathematical operations (Square Root, Logarithm, Sine) using the `math` module.
- **report.md**: A detailed report and documentation for Assignment 3 tasks.

## How to Run
