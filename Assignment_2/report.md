# Assignment 2 Report

## Task1.py

### Description:
This script accepts an integer input from the user and determines whether it is even or odd.
- **Logic**: It uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`). If `num & 1` equals 0, the binary representation ends in 0, meaning the number is even. Otherwise, it is odd.
- **Alternative**: The code also contains a commented-out section showing the standard modulo operator (`%`) approach.

### Code:
```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num & 1 == 0 or num == 0:
    print(num, "is even")
else:
    print(num, "is odd")

"""
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(num, "is even")
else:
    print(num, "is odd")
"""
```

### Output:
**Example 1:**
```
Enter a number: 10
10 is even
```

**Example 2:**
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is odd
```

## Task2.py

### Description:
This script calculates the sum of a sequence of numbers.
- **Logic**: It initializes a variable `sum` to 0. Then, it uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers generated by `range(1, 50)` (which generates numbers from 1 up to, but not including, 50).
- **Result**: It accumulates the value of each number into `sum` and prints the final total.

### Code:
```python
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 50):
    sum += i
print(sum)
```

### Output:
```
1225
```
