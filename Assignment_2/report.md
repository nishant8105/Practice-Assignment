# Assignment 2 Report

## Task1.py

### Description:
This script accepts an integer input from the user and determines whether it is even or odd.
- **Logic**: It uses the modulo operator (`%`). If `num % 2` equals 0, the number is even. Otherwise, it is odd.
- **Alternative**: The code also contains a commented-out section showing the bitwise AND operator (`&`) approach.

### Code:
```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# if num & 1 == 0 or num == 0:
#     print(num, "is even")
# else:
#     print(num, "is odd")


if num % 2 == 0:
    print(num, "is even")
else:
    print(num, "is odd")

```

### Output:
**Example 1:**
```
Enter a number: 10
10 is even
```

**Example 2:**
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is odd
```

## Task2.py

### Description:
This script calculates the sum of a sequence of numbers.
- **Logic**: It initializes a variable `sum` to 0. Then, it uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers generated by `range(1, 51)` (which generates numbers from 1 up to, but not including, 51).
- **Result**: It accumulates the value of each number into `sum` and prints the final total.

### Code:
```python
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 51): # count from 1 to 50 as 51 is excluded
    sum += i # for each iteration it add number and save in sum
print(f"The sum of number from 1 to 50 is : {sum}")
```

### Output:
```
The sum of number from 1 to 50 is : 1275
```
